# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The goal for this week was to try out React Native and build my first mobile app. I decided to make an app for children who are curious about space. The app is using the accelerometer sensor - simply shake the phone or click the button to learn cool things about space.

## The problem

I spent a lot of time looking for an appropriate API to use for this project. I wanted to fetch facts about space and generate that fact using onPress. In the end I created an array with 10 facts about space and a function that randomly generates that fact, when you click a button.
As an other feature I'm using accelerometer sensor to detect when the phone is shaking, and then generates fact from the same array. I had problem with connecting my phone to Expo to be able to try out the shake sensor and time was running out. So this is still a work in progress.
